## Mapping to the Human Services Data Standard

This drawing sketches how the [Open Referral HSDS Specification](https://github.com/openreferral/specification) maps to specific existing (real world) models.

What we each say about how human service data is organized is often encapsulated in the standard.

## Open Referral

The Open Referral Initiative develops data standards and open platforms that make it easy to share and find information about community resources. Learn more about the initiative at [OpenReferral.org](https://openreferral.org).


### Standards

The Open Referral initiative defines two standards - the Human Services Data Specification and the Human Services Data API.

Human Services Data Specification defines a minimal set of data for publishing machine-readable directory information about health, human, and social services; their locations and accessibility details; and the organizations that provide them. Read the [spec here](https://docs.openreferral.org).
